Welcome! I am currrently an asscociate professor at Department of Polymer Materials and Science, Jiaxing University, P.R. China, working on the polymer physics and the structure-properties relations of polymer materials using molecular dynamics simulations.

My current research interests lie in developing and using computational techniques –  molecular modeling, simulations, statistical theory, and machine learning – to design new materials & better understand their structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics for target applications in energy, optics and biomedical fields.
