## Syllabus (教学大纲)
### Course Description (课程介绍)
The course provides an overview of the chemical processes and principles involved in the synthesis of different types of polymers molecules. Topics covered include the common synthetic methods, such as bulk polymerisation, condensation polymerisation, solution polymerisation, and emulsion polymerisation; material characterisation techniques; the various factors which impact polymer structure and performance, such as chain topology, chain length, branching, and cross-linking; and the scale-up of lab-scale solutions to industrial settings. Students will gain an understanding of the techniques involved in polymer synthesis and their application in industrial fields such as engineering, automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Practical lab sessions will also give students the opportunity to gain ensemble experience in polymer synthesis, as well as reinforcing the key principles covered in the lectures.
