This course will provide an overview of the principles and fundamentals of polymer processing.

## Syllabus (教学大纲)
#### Course Description (课程介绍)
This course will provide an overview of the principles and fundamentals of polymer processing. The major topics covered will include polymer properties, rheology, extrusion & injection moulding, blow moulding, and thermoforming. The focus of this course will be to understand the behaviour of polymers under various processing conditions and how to create acceptable and consistent end products from these materials. Students will learn about the important properties of polymers which determine their suitability for processing and the methods used to process these materials, including extrusion, injection moulding, calendaring and other techniques. There will be an exploration of methods used to achieve efficient manufacturing processes with good dimensional accuracy, uniformity and consistency of product quality. Practical lab sessions will also give students the opportunity to gain ensemble experience in polymer processing, as well as reinforcing the key principles covered in the lectures.
