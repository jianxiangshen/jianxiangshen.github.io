This course provides an introduction to the concepts of surface modification of polymer materials.

## Syllabus (教学大纲)
### Course Description (课程介绍)
This course provides an introduction to the concepts of surface modification of polymer materials. Various techniques are discussed, including established techniques such as plasma etching, chemical treatments, and mechanical processes, as well as emerging techniques such as nanotechnologies and biomimetic techniques. Attention is also given to the influence of both external and internal factors on the physical and chemical properties of the polymer surface. The applications of the various surface modification techniques are discussed, in terms of their potential to improve properties such as wear and abrasion resistance, lubricity, biocompatibility, surface hygiene, and other benefits. At the end of the course, students will have a good understanding of the principles of surface modification of polymers and be able to apply them for the design of improved products. The class will be conducted in a lecture-discussion format, supplemented by class discussions and examples. Assignments and laboratory activities may be assigned to reinforce classroom materials.
