**Abstract**: In this work, the structural and dynamical properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/fullerene (C<sub>60</sub>) nanocomposites are investigated using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the glass transition, thermal expansion, polymer mobility, polymer–C<sub>60</sub> interactions, and diffusion behavior of C<sub>60</sub>. The results show a slight increase in the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) with increasing C<sub>60</sub> weight fraction (wt%), attributed to hindered polymer dynamics, and a remarkable reduction in the coefficient of thermal expansion above T<sub>g</sub>. Results of the mean squared displacement and the time decay of bond-reorientation autocorrelation indicate that the mobility of TPU hard segments is more restricted than that of soft segments, owing to the electrostatic attractions and the π–π stacking between isocyanate groups and C<sub>60</sub> molecules. Analysis of TPU–C60 interaction energy reveals that the electrostatic interactions are weakened with an increase in the C<sub>60</sub> wt%, while the van der Waals contributions become more significant due to the TPU–C<sub>60</sub> interfacial characteristics. Further analysis shows that the translational and rotational diffusion of C60 are both increasingly suppressed with the increase of C<sub>60</sub> wt%, indicating a violation of Stokes–Einstein (SE) and Stokes–Einstein-Debye (SED) relations, presumably due to the polymer chain-mediated hydrodynamic interactions arising from chain bridges between neighboring C<sub>60</sub> particles. This is highlighted by a stronger decoupling of translational–rotational diffusion and a lower ratio of translational–rotational diffusion coefficient (D<sub>T</sub>/D<sub>R</sub>) with increasing C<sub>60</sub> wt%. This work elucidates an atomistic understanding of the structure and properties of polymer/C<sub>60</sub> nanocomposites.
